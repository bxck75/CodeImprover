TODOS:
    - Add type hints to method arguments and return types.
    - Refactor the code into a callable class if needed.
    - Add a __name__ == "__main__" block if needed.
    - Add additional methods for code analysis and improvement.

Description:
    The General class provides functionality to improve code blocks by removing trailing whitespaces.
    It also includes a placeholder method for running experimental code logic.
Usage:
    1. Create an instance of the General class.
    2. Call the improve_codeblocks() method with a list of codeblocks to remove trailing whitespaces.
    3. The method will return a list of codeblocks with improved formatting.
    4. Use the run_experimental_code() method to execute experimental code logic.
Predicted use cases:
    1. Pre-processing codeblocks before further analysis.
Proposed features:
    - Add additional methods for code analysis and improvement.
