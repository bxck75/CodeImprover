description:
    This script provides a `DataHandler` class that can perform various data handling operations. It allows loading and saving any file, gathering files from a folder recursively, zipping and unzipping files, initializing a SQLite database, tokenizing a file and storing it in a SQLite database, and storing data in a vectorstore.

usage:
    1. Initialize the `DataHandler` object: `data_handler = DataHandler()`
    2. Use the provided methods to perform various data handling operations.

predicted use cases:
    - Handling and manipulating files and folders.
    - Working with SQLite databases.
    - Performing text processing tasks.
    - Storing and retrieving data in a vectorstore.

proposed features:
    - Ability to search and filter data in the vectorstore.
    - Support for different file formats in the `load_file` and `save_file` methods.
    - Additional database operations like querying, updating, and deleting data.
